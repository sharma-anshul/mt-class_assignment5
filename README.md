# Language Identification

Project subdirectory: vid

The problem posed by vid's project was of language identifcation. Using the training data, I created ngram frequency vectors. I did the same thing for the test data and calculated the dot product for each language. 

I achieved a precision of 0.93 on the dev set.

To run the code:

> python src/identifier > output

To grade:

> python grade < output
